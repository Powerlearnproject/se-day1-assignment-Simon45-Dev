#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, maintenance, and testing of software. It involves a structured approach to designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software systems to ensure they are reliable, efficient, and meet user requirements.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s):Structured programming introduced a disciplined approach to coding, emphasizing the use of control structures like loops and conditionals instead of "goto" statements
The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): Object-oriented programming (OOP) brought a new way of thinking about software design by organizing code into "objects" that represent real-world entities
The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s): Agile methodologies revolutionized software development by promoting iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. Frameworks like Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP) emphasized delivering small, incremental updates to software, allowing teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements and improve product quality continuously.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: This phase involves defining the scope, objectives, and feasibility of the project. It includes resource allocation, risk assessment, and creating a project plan.
Requirements Analysis: In this phase, the needs and expectations of the users are gathered and documented. This helps in understanding what the software should achieve and the constraints it must operate within Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Design: The design phase involves creating the architecture of the software. This includes defining the system components, interfaces, and data flow. It results in detailed design specifications that guide the development process.
Implementation (Coding): During this phase, the actual code is written based on the design specifications. Developers use programming languages and tools to build the software components
Testing: Testing involves verifying that the software works as intended and is free of defects. This phase includes various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing
Deployment: In this phase, the software is released to the users. It involves installing the software in the production environment and ensuring it is operational
Maintenance" After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is updated and improved over time. This includes fixing bugs, adding new features, and making performance enhancements

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer (Software Engineer): A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications. They translate business requirements into functional software solutions
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures the software meets quality standards before deployment. They identify bugs, inconsistencies, and security vulnerabilities
Project Manager (Software Project Manager): A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects, ensuring they meet deadlines, budget constraints, and business goals.
